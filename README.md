# SageMaker MLOps Tutorial: Implementation Notes & Troubleshooting

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of AWS's MLOps tutorial using SageMaker, focusing on automating ML workflows. The original tutorial can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial-mlops-automate-ml-workflows/).

## Known Issues
### Data Processing Job Error
When implementing the tutorial, you may encounter a cryptic error during the Data Processing job:

```
ClientError: Failed to invoke sagemaker:CreateProcessingJob. Error Details: null
```

### Root Cause & Solution
The error occurs when attempting to use CSV files from the public S3 bucket `s3://sagemaker-sample-files`. To resolve this, you'll need to copy the required files to your own S3 bucket before proceeding with the tutorial.

### Troubleshooting Notes
- This error message is not descriptive enough to indicate the actual problem
- Standard AI assistance tools (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, ChatGPT-4) were unable to provide meaningful guidance due to the non-specific nature of the error
- The SageMaker ecosystem would benefit from more detailed error messages in such scenarios
